Biography: 

Marty Wood is a writer, researcher, and curator who brings communities, methodologies, and ideas into contact. He believes that varied forms of engagement and practice—from research to history to criticism—produce new ways of thinking about design and enrich creative cultures.

Wood is launching General Economy, a new multi-channel platform for critical conversations at the intersection of art, architecture, and urban spatial politics. With the rapid acceleration and constant churning of the cultural and aesthetic fields, General Economy hopes to circulate new ideas and foreground new voices within larger artistic, social, and theoretical contexts.
